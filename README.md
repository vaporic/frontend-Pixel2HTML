# Pixel2HTML Test Project

---

## Requeriments

### Do's
- **Gulp/Grunt** is a must. Use it to make the magic happen.
- Use a **CSS Preprocessor**, you can choose between [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) or [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/).
- Use the **grid**! (You can use any existing CSS Framework (*Hint: We like BASSCSS*), or you can use yours)
- We expect **cross-browsing** (IE+9, Chrome, FF) and **cross-device** (Desktop + Table + Mobile) compatibility
- **Validate all form inputs** as required, and email as a wellformed email using [Parsley](http://parsleyjs.org/)
- Make everything Retina Ready

### Dont's
- Do not use any image, everything should be made using CSS3. The only image required is our logo and a SVG is incluided in our `assets` folder.

## Nice to have

- Add a nice animation (we like [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css) & [WOW.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/)).
- Minify the assets.
- Clean and format your stylesheet using unCSS and CSSComb.

## Deliverables

- The files should be pushed to your Github account, if you don't have one you can
follow this link: https://github.com/join to get one, it's free!
- Cross-check all the details before pushing the final code for review.
- Track the time you spend (You can use [TOGGL](https://www.toggl.com/) for this, be honest :D)
